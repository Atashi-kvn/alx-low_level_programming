Introduction

This project contains several tasks related to programming and problem-solving. Each task is described below, along with any relevant files or instructions.

Task 0: Multiple mains

In this task, you are given a main file that tests a "positive_or_negative()" function. Your goal is to copy the main file and comment out the part of the code that causes an infinite loop. You should not add or remove any lines of code. The goal is to practice commenting out code and working with multiple main functions.

Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

In this task, you are given a main file that prints a series of numbers in an infinite loop. Your goal is to comment out the code that causes the infinite loop, without adding or removing any lines of code. The goal is to practice commenting out code and working with basic control flow.

Task 2: 0 > 972?

In this task, you are given a program that finds the largest of three integers. Your goal is to review the code and ensure that it correctly handles all possible cases, including negative numbers and ties. The goal is to practice reviewing and debugging code.

Task 3: Leap year

In this task, you are given a program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into consideration. Your goal is to review the code and ensure that it correctly handles all possible cases, including leap years and invalid dates. The goal is to practice reviewing and debugging code.
