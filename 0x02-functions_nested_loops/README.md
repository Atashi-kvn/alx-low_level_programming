# Functions, nested loops


As part of my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School, I completed a project that aimed to teach me about header files, functions, loops, and nested loops in the C language.

To complete the project, I wrote programs in C that were compiled using gcc 4.8.4 and written according to the C90 standard. The programs were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Here are the files that were created during the project, along with a brief description of what each program does:
Filename	Description
0-Putchar.c	Prints the word "Putchar"
1-alphabet.c	Prints the alphabet in lowercase
2-print_alphabet_x10.c	Prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times
3-islower.c	Checks if a character is lowercase
4-isalpha.c	Checks if a character is alphabetic
5-sign.c	Prints the sign of a number
6-abs.c	Computes the absolute value of an integer
7-print_last_digit.c	Prints the last digit of a number
8-24_hours.c	Prints every minute of a day
9-times_table.c	Prints the multiplication table for the number 9
10-add.c	Adds two integers and returns the result
11-print_to_98.c	Prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98
100-times_table.c	Prints the multiplication table for a given number
101-natural.c	Computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
102-fibonacci.c	Prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
103-fibonacci.c	Finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence
104-fibonacci.c	Finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers

Through this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of C programming concepts such as functions, loops, and nested loops, and I feel more confident in my ability to use these tools to create useful programs.
